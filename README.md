# Movie-Ticket-API
This Application was created to reserver movie tickets using the API International Showtimes

The API access for limited time only just for demo purposes, So if the fetch can't access movie, I would suggest chaning API_KEY variable in js/index.js
```js
const API_KEY = "&apikey=//Your Key//";
```
